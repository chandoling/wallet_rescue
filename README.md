# wallet_rescue

This project allows you to bundle and send ERC-20 tokens. The configuration includes sponsor and compromised wallet settings, ERC-20 token contract addresses, and specific gas settings for each transaction.

## Settings

- **Gas Price**: Adjust the gas price according to your network.
- **ERC-20 Contract Address**: Set the ERC-20 token contract address (ca).
- **Private Key of Sponsor Wallet**: Enter the private key of the sponsor wallet (responsible for covering gas).
- **Private Key of Compromised Wallet**: Enter the private key of the compromised wallet (the wallet losing access).
- **Amount of ERC-20**: Specify the amount of ERC-20 tokens to transfer.

## ERC-20 Token Bundler

This tool facilitates ERC-20 token recovery for compromised wallets. The compromised wallet's assets are securely transferred to a sponsor wallet that covers the gas costs.
